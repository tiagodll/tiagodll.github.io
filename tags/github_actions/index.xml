      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t like managing servers. This is a well-known fact. My way around it was to set up all my apps using docker, and that made me happy.
After my small server ran out of space with only 5 web apps running, I started changing my mind. On top of this, I used GitHub actions with azure, and loved it.
For that reason I moved my dotnet webapp from docker to a Linux service automatically deployed by github actions.</description>
