      <description>So seems like asp.net mvc is finally popular? That&amp;rsquo;s perfect, I mean, this is how it should have been since the beginning.

It means that the view should be only responsible for showing the interface, the data access should be in the model layer, and everything else should be done by the controller.</description>
