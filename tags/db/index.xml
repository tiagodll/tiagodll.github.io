      <description>Today I had an error message driving me crazy:
`method_missing&amp;#39;: undefined method `export_format&amp;#39; for XXX model You see, our model is a gem itself, because it is shared by several projects. When we have something in the schema that is not in the database, that is the error we get.
Now, I knew this error from previous executions, but my model was in synch with the DB.
I tried to comment out all my changes, without luck.</description>
