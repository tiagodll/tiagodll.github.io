      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t like managing servers. This is a well-known fact. My way around it was to set up all my apps using docker, and that made me happy.
After my small server ran out of space with only 5 web apps running, I started changing my mind. On top of this, I used GitHub actions with azure, and loved it.
For that reason I moved my dotnet webapp from docker to a Linux service automatically deployed by github actions.</description>

      <description>my certificate is expired and certbot This gives me a message &amp;ldquo;your current client, does not support ACME v2 at all. You will need to migrate to a different one&amp;rdquo;, but there is nothing I can do to update my certbot.
So I did some googling around, and found nothing that helped me.
It is worth to note that this was in an old server with ubuntu 17.
Now there is one thing I can do: remove it and install it again!</description>
