      <description>Background Why I am writing about markdown, isn&amp;rsquo;t this boring?
No my little padawan, markdown have quickly climbed to be my favorite text editing tool.
During a few years I worked in a custom blog engine. After that in a social network for traders.
In both cases, editing the content was crucial for the software, and having tried many, many different WYSIWYG editors, I gave up.
No matter what we did (yes, specially in the second case, there was a big team involved), the users always found ways to break our editor and generate invalid data.</description>
